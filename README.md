"When you play a match, it is statistically proven that players actually have the ball 3 minutes on average … So, the most important thing is: what do you do during those 87 minutes when you do not have the ball. That is what determines wether you’re a good player or not." - Johan Cruyff

Actually this quote has nothing to do with this project, but come on, it's Cruyff talking about statistics!

However, in this project I used the Statsbomb open events data, So even though we can't Know much about players how do not have the ball, we still can know a lot about the overall performance of Barcelona throgh seasons from 2004/2005 to 2019/2020.

## It's a Data Product 

I build a shiny web app to explore the events data for Barcelona in 4 main ways. you can choose one of four plots, two seasons to compare, and you can remove some players to see how the team perform without them and then you can know how much they affected the team.

## The Passes to Penalty Plot

It is well known that Barcelona likes possission of the ball, but with that been said, the purpose of keeping the ball is the same purpose of any other tactics in football, create chances and prevent the oppunent from creating chances, so this plot will tell you how many times did Barcelona move the ball to the penalty area (by either passes or carries) and from where.

## The Pressure Plot

You can either close the spaces behined you, or eleminate the oppunent time on the ball, and by that I mean the time from the player recived the ball until he decided what to do with it. And as Barcelona likes attack, and and leaves a lot of space behiened, It is essential to make high pressure after loosing the ball so that the oppunent can't use the space to threating Barcelona goal. this plot is about where Barcelona applys pressure.
